# github-pages-generator

A setup for creating documentation that can be published to Github pages. Creating a React app for this purpose is tedious, and this is a reference for doing so.

`npm run build` will take the app in ./example and compile it into a single index.html file in ./docs. Javascript assets are included inline.

`npm run dev` serves the app locally with hot reloading using webpack-dev-server on the default port.
